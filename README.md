FileHider
=========

This python script can easily hide any kind of file into any other! 

For example you could hide a secret message on a picture, share it with your friends or post it publicly and  as long as the file is not modified, any other user could open the picture, document, bitmap, webpage and unless they know there is a secret message in it, they wouldn't find anything unusual about it (unless you try to hide 1.2GB of data on a picture).

#### Features:

- Hides any file into any other file
- Recovers any file hidden by this script
- Recovers file extension (Trust me, its a feature)
- Its awesome!
